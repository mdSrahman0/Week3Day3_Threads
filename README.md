NOTE - Number 1 and 2 are the only ones working right now. For number 1, please check the logcat.

1. Use Java Thread/Runnables to calculate pi to 12 digits
2. Use AsyncTask to sort an array of 1000 randomly generated numbers
3. Use a looper to calculate the Fibonacci sequence unto the 20th iteration
4. Create a small Sqlite database and use a loader to perform any crud operations from the database 
(You can have as many fields as you want, just make sure to use the loaders for any crud operations
